# How does it work?
## Dragonfly apps
At the core of Dragonly is the Dragonfly app
{% highlight ruby %}
app = Dragonfly.app
{% endhighlight %}

This is configured using
{% highlight ruby %}
app.configure do
  # configuration goes here
end
{% endhighlight %}
See [Configuration]({% post_url 0000-02-01-configuration %}) for more details.

Normally you will just need the default Dragonfly app, but if you wish you can have multiple apps, each with its own configuration, by giving each a name, e.g.
{% highlight ruby %}
app1 = Dragonfly.app(:audio)
app2 = Dragonfly.app(:images)
{% endhighlight %}

## Parts of a Dragonfly App
An app comprises of the following:

  - a **datastore** for storing content and metadata
  - any number of **processors** for modifying content
  - any number of **generators** for creating content
  - any number of **analysers** for analysing content
  - a Rack **server** object for serving content

## Jobs
A Job object represents a chained sequence of commands, e.g.
{% highlight ruby %}
image = Dragonfly.app.fetch('2008/dog.png').thumb('300x300')
{% endhighlight %}
represents the commands

  1. fetch the content with uid "2008/dog.png" from the datastore
  2. process this content with the registered "thumb" processor

### URLs
We can get a url for this job with
{% highlight ruby %}
image.url   # ===> "/W1siZiIsIjIwMDgvZG9nLnBuZyJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiMzAweDMwMCJdXQ"
{% endhighlight %}
The commands "fetch the content then process" are encoded into this url.

The Dragonfly app is itself a Rack app which responds with the fetched/processed content when we visit this url!

### Using the content
The job object above is lazy, so it hasn't actually _done_ any fetching or processing.

We can force it to do it using `apply`

{% highlight ruby %}
image.apply
{% endhighlight %}

but we normally won't need to, because any methods that need the resultant content call `apply` behind the scenes. Examples are:

{% highlight ruby %}
image.data                   # ===> a String containing the data
image.to_file('out.png')     # writes to file 'out.png' and returns a readable file object
image.tempfile               # ===> a closed Tempfile object
image.file                   # ===> a readable (open) File object
image.file do |f|            # Yields an open file object, returns the return value of
  data = f.read(256)         #  the block, and closes the file object
end
image.path                   # ===> e.g. "/var/st..." i.e. the path of the tempfile
image.b64_data               # ===> data url like "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw..."

image.meta                   # ===> the stored metadata, e.g. {"name" => "dog.png", ...}
image.name                   # ===> taken from meta["name"], e.g. "dog.png"
image.basename               # ===> taken from name, e.g. "dog"
image.ext                    # ===> taken from name, e.g. "png"
image.mime_type              # ===> "image/png", taken from ext

image.size                   # ===> 134507 (size in bytes)

image.width                  # ===> 288 - one of the registered analysers
{% endhighlight %}
